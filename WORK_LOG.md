| Feb 3rd | 8:45 - 9:20 pm  | I worked on thinking how best to solve diff, beginning by thinking of the heating up solution because we had aldready idenfitifed similarities within the two problem sets. I think because of how this problem is set up, we should be able to use tabulation, and I also feel like we should be able to solve it using a 1d array because of the overall nature of how the problem is structured, with the comparision of two 1d arrays. Thinking of optimal substructures, I feel like this is where heating up can be useful, because if we treat each run as pre-calculated and store it, we don't have to reassess a  shared run-> and we can just compare max values. I think where it begins to differ is that instead of simply calculating the max for one array, we are comparing two maximums, so instead of storing the max value like we did in heating up, we can compare two string run lengths-- see if they are the same, and if they are, only compare the additional chars being added each time from there. That way, its a much faster comparision. |

It proves more difficult than I thought because heating up was just tracking if something is increasing, but in this scenario, its the matching that determines the run length-> so you can't just seperately calc two run lengths and compare them, you have to match each element--> and a match could occur at different points in different strings of text, so you'd have to wait for a match to occur. This could be solved with nested for loops- but it would be extremely ineffcient, and I don't know if tabulation would necesarily speed it up. |

However, I tried storing the completed comparisions at each point, so that we wouldn't have to recalculate them at different points, so the calculations occuring at each point in the loop will be minimized. This resulted in a working solution, however, I am confident that this is not the right way to approach the problem simply because it will run at minimum n^2 time where n is the length of one of the strings being checked. |
